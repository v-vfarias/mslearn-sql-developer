## Create a custom instruction file for Copilot

Custom instruction files guide Copilot to generate code that follows your team's standards. Create an instruction file for T-SQL development.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the folder where you want to store your database project (or create a new folder).
1. Create a new folder named `.github` in the root of your project.
1. Create a new file named `copilot-instructions.md` inside the `.github` folder.
1. Add the following content to the instruction file:

    ```markdown
    # T-SQL Development Guidelines for Copilot

    ## Naming Conventions
    - Tables: PascalCase, singular form (Customer, Product, SalesOrder)
    - Columns: PascalCase (FirstName, OrderDate, UnitPrice)
    - Stored procedures: usp_ActionEntity (usp_GetCustomerOrders, usp_InsertProduct)
    - Views: vw_EntityDescription (vw_ActiveCustomers, vw_ProductInventory)
    - Indexes: IX_TableName_ColumnName

    ## T-SQL Style Guidelines
    - Always use explicit column lists in SELECT statements (avoid SELECT *)
    - Include schema prefix for all objects (SalesLT.Product, SalesLT.Customer)
    - Use ANSI JOIN syntax (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) instead of comma-separated tables
    - Include SET NOCOUNT ON at the beginning of stored procedures
    - Use TRY...CATCH blocks for error handling in stored procedures

    ## Security Requirements
    - Use parameterized queries, never concatenate user input
    - Never include actual credentials or connection strings in code
    - Use least-privilege principles for GRANT statements

    ## Comments
    - Include a header comment with procedure name, purpose, and author
    - Add inline comments for complex logic
    ```

1. Save the file. Copilot will now consider these guidelines when generating T-SQL code.

---

## Use Copilot to generate a stored procedure

Now use GitHub Copilot to generate a stored procedure following your custom guidelines.

1. In Visual Studio Code, create a new file named `usp_GetCustomerOrderSummary.sql`.
1. Open the **Copilot Chat** panel by pressing **Ctrl+Alt+I** (or selecting the Copilot Chat icon).
1. Make sure the **Mode** is set to **Ask** in the bottom-left of the Copilot Chat panel.
1. In the chat, type the following prompt:

    ```text
    Create a stored procedure named usp_GetCustomerOrderSummary that retrieves customer order information from the AdventureWorksLT database. The procedure should:
    - Accept a @CustomerID parameter (optional, if NULL return all customers)
    - Return customer name, total number of orders, total order amount, and last order date
    - Join SalesLT.Customer, SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader, and SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail tables
    - Include error handling with TRY...CATCH
    - Follow the T-SQL guidelines in the instruction file
    ```

1. Review the generated code. Notice how Copilot follows your naming conventions and style guidelines.
1. If needed, ask Copilot to refine the code:

    ```text
    Add a comment header and ensure the procedure uses SET NOCOUNT ON
    ```

1. Copy the final stored procedure code to your SQL file.

---

## Use Copilot to generate a view

Use Copilot to create a view that supports your application needs.

1. Create a new file named `vw_ProductSalesAnalysis.sql`.
1. In the Copilot Chat panel, enter the following prompt:

    ```text
    Create a view named vw_ProductSalesAnalysis that shows:
    - Product name and category
    - Total quantity sold
    - Total revenue
    - Average sale price
    - Number of orders containing this product
    
    Use the SalesLT schema tables and follow the T-SQL guidelines.
    ```

1. Review the generated code and verify it follows your naming conventions and style guidelines.
1. Copy the code to your SQL file.

---

## Use Copilot to explain existing code

Copilot can also help you understand existing database code.

1. In the **SQL Server** connection pane, expand **Views** under your database.
1. Right-click on `SalesLT.vGetAllCategories` and select **Script as Create**.
1. Select the entire view code in the editor.
1. Open Copilot Chat and type:

    ```text
    Explain what this view does and how the recursive CTE works
    ```

1. Review the explanation. Copilot analyzes the code and provides a clear description of its functionality.

---

## Use Copilot for query optimization suggestions

Ask Copilot to help optimize a query.

1. Create a new file named `query_optimization.sql`.
1. Type or paste the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader h, SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail d, SalesLT.Product p
    WHERE h.SalesOrderID = d.SalesOrderID
    AND d.ProductID = p.ProductID
    AND h.OrderDate > '2008-01-01'
    ```

1. Select the query and open Copilot Chat.
1. Type the following prompt:

    ```text
    Review this query and suggest optimizations following best practices. Explain each improvement.
    ```

1. Review Copilot's suggestions, which should include:
    - Converting to explicit ANSI JOIN syntax
    - Replacing SELECT * with specific column names
    - Adding schema prefixes
    - Potentially adding indexes
